# Fundamental Analysis Models (Google Sheets)

This repository contains my Google Sheets models for fundamental equity analysis, inspired by professional financial modeling practices. Each model tracks and evaluates a company’s fundamentals over time based in the general investing phylosophy of Benjamin Graham, including:

- Market Cap & Shares Outstanding
- Balance Sheet Items (Debt, Cash, Assets, Liabilities)
- Income Statements Items
- Cash Flow Statements Items
- Enterprise Value (EV)
- Quarterly & Annual Trends
- Custom Ratios

## Features

- Structured time-series view of financials by quarter and year.
- Built-in formulas for quick valuation metrics.
- Easily extendable for new companies or additional ratios.
- Ready to integrate with Google Finance functions or APIs for automation.

## Purpose

These models reflect my practical approach to data analysis in investing. They combine:

- Accounting & finance knowledge – understanding key metrics.
- Data structuring – clean, tabular format for time-series analysis.
- Automation-ready design – set up for future API integrations (Yahoo Finance, FinancialModelingPrep, etc.).

## Roadmap

- Automate market cap & shares outstanding retrieval.
- Add historical comparisons & visual dashboards.
- Expand coverage to multiple companies with portfolio-level summaries.
